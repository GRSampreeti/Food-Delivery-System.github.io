## üöÄ Introduction
The food delivery system is a vital part of modern urban life, providing convenience and accessibility to a variety of cuisines from local restaurants. This portfolio focuses on the development and optimization of a food delivery platform to streamline the ordering process, enhance user experience, and facilitate efficient delivery logistics.

## ‚ùì Why Food Delivery System?
- Food delivery systems offer convenience, variety, and accessibility to users, allowing them to enjoy restaurant-quality meals from the comfort of their homes.
- The platform serves as a bridge between customers and restaurants, facilitating seamless transactions and efficient delivery operations.
- With the increasing demand for food delivery services, there is a growing opportunity to innovate and improve the food delivery experience for both customers and businesses.

## üéØ Objectives
The objectives of this portfolio include:
- Demonstrating proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving within the context of food delivery systems.
- Highlighting the role of algorithms in optimizing various processes such as order management, delivery routing, and real-time tracking in food delivery platforms.
- Presenting real-world use cases and innovative solutions tailored to the challenges encountered within the food delivery domain.

## üé® Design
The design of the food delivery system focuses on simplicity, efficiency, and reliability. Key components include:
- Customer-facing mobile app for browsing menus, placing orders, and tracking deliveries.
- Restaurant portal for managing menus, orders, and inventory.
- Delivery driver app for receiving assignments, navigating routes, and updating status.
- Backend infrastructure for processing orders, coordinating deliveries, and managing user accounts.
