  ordered database of restaurants or menus based on attributes such as name, cuisine type, or ratings. <br/>
**Time complexity in big O notation**
| Operation    | Average    | Worst case |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Search       | O(log n)   | O(n)       |
| Insert       | O(log n)   | O(n)       |
| Delete       | O(log n)   | O(n)       |

**Space Complexity**
